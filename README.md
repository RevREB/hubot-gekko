# Hubot

This is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, hubot. He's pretty cool.

This version is designed to be run on Heroku or locally - https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md#deploying

# Requirements

- This project is specifically for the "gekko script".  There might be a better way to setup this project, like via a fork of hubot-scripts, but this will do for now.
- You'll need to be sure your Gekko instance is configured with redis settings turned on.  An example can be found here - https://github.com/streetlogics/gekko/blob/hubot/config/examples/hubot.js
